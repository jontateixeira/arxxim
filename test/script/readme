python scripts for arxim

= arxim_map_activity.py
equilibrium assemblages as a function of the activities of two independent species

= arxim_map_dominant.py
for a system with a given total amount of element X, map the domination domains of the different X-bearing species in solution. The mapping on a given grid is done first, then the limits between domains are refined. 

= arxim_map_dominant_2.py
same as arxim_map_dominant.py, with the refining called within the mapping routine

= arxim_map_tp.py
equilibrium assemblages as a function of T and P

= arxim_map_tp_0.py
same as arxim_map_tp.py, specifically for Al2SiO5 system, computing G's using MyThermo instead of arxim

= arxim_map_xt_fm.py
example of X,T diagram with X=Fe/(Fe+Mg) and the possibility to chage P along T

= arxim_map_xt_fsp.py
example of X,T diagram for feldspar solid solution with X=Or/(Or+Ab) and the possibility to change P along T

= MyLib.py
= MyLibTk.py
= MyThermo.py

= path_XY_plot.py
