The objective of the arxim project is to develop a library for calculations of heterogeneous equilibrium in systems of arbitrary complexity. Originally developed as a "geochemical module" of a reactive transport code for water - rock interaction, the project is currently oriented toward fluid-rock systems, but its general architecture should be adaptable to a larger range of applications.
